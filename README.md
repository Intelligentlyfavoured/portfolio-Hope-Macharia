## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

- **Branching**: Helped me separate features and prevent conflicts when working on different sections of the site.  
  *Example:* Used `feature/home-page`, `feature/about-section` branches to keep work organized and merge only when ready.

- **Commit Messages & Issue References**: Writing clear, descriptive commit messages and referencing issues (e.g., `feat: add intro (#1)`) made it easy to trace changes and close issues automatically.

- **Pull Requests**: Creating PRs for each feature branch encouraged reviewing changes before merging, improving code quality and enabling discussion around issues.

- **Milestones & GitHub Issues**: Grouping issues under the `v1.0 Portfolio Launch` milestone kept the project on track and provided a clear roadmap for what needed to be delivered by June 24, 2025.
